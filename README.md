## 🧠 About Me

I’m a final-year Computer Science student with a deep obsession for **Machine Learning that actually works in production**.  
Not toy notebooks. Not copy-paste Kaggle stuff.  
I focus on **end-to-end AI systems** — from data → model → explainability → deployment.

I believe in old-school fundamentals (math, logic, discipline) mixed with modern tools (PyTorch, FastAPI, LLMs).  
The goal? **Build AI that people can trust.**

## 🚀 What I’m Currently Building

### 🩺 **MedVision AI** — Medical Image Intelligence (XAI)
- Chest X-ray classification using **ResNet50**
- Achieved **92–95% accuracy**
- Integrated **Grad-CAM** for explainability (because black-box models don’t belong in healthcare)
- Deployed with **FastAPI** for real-time inference  
📌 *Designed for high-stakes, regulated ML environments*

---

### 🧠 **IntelliBot PRO+** — Advanced AI Assistant Platform
- Intent classification + PDF Q&A
- LLM-powered responses (OpenAI + Gemini)
- Secure API handling with `.env`
- Custom frontend (not Streamlit) with animations, themes & avatars
- Built to scale, not just impress  
📌 *Shows real-world NLP + system design skills*

---

### 🚨 **SafeCity AI** — Intelligent Surveillance & Event Detection
- Detects **accidents, violence & anomalies**
- Computer Vision–driven event pipeline
- Structured logging & dashboard-ready outputs
- Designed for **smart cities & public safety use-cases**  
📌 *Not just detection — actionable intelligence*

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Battle-Tested)

**Languages**  
- Python • C++ • Swift

**ML / AI**  
- PyTorch • TensorFlow • YOLOv8  
- Scikit-learn • Hugging Face  
- Grad-CAM • Transfer Learning

**Backend & APIs**  
- FastAPI • Flask  
- REST APIs • Model Serving

**MLOps & Tools**  
- Git • Docker (learning)  
- Environment-based config (`.env`)  
- Logging & evaluation pipelines

---

## 📊 What Makes My Work Different

✅ Production mindset (not notebook-only)  
✅ Explainability > blind accuracy  
✅ Clean project structure  
✅ Real-world problem selection  
✅ Focus on **impact, not hype**

Most people learn models.  
I learn **systems**.

## 🎯 Career Focus

I’m actively looking for roles in:
- **Machine Learning Engineer**
- **Computer Vision Engineer**
- **Applied AI / Research Engineer (Entry-Level)**

I’m especially interested in teams solving **real problems** — healthcare, safety, automation, intelligent systems.

### ⚡ Fun Fact

I’d rather spend 10 hours fixing one real bug  
than spend 10 minutes flexing fake metrics.

If you’re here, you’re probably building something real too 🤝
